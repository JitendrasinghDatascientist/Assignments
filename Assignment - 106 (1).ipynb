    "SQL, or Structured Query Language, was developed by IBM in the 1970s. Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce are often credited with its invention. They initially created SQL as part of a research project at IBM, aiming to develop a language for managing and querying databases. Their work laid the foundation for what would become one of the most widely used languages for managing relational databases."
